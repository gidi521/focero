		five:{
			title:'What is Pomodoro Technique?',
			content:'The Pomodoro Technique, developed by Francesco Cirillo, is a time management method designed to enhance productivity in work and study. It involves using a timer to divide tasks into intervals, typically lasting 25 minutes, followed by short breaks. Each of these intervals is called a "pomodoro," which means "tomato" in Italian, named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used during his university days.',
		},
		six:{
			title:'Why the Pomodoro Technique Works',
			content:'The Pomodoro Technique works because it leverages the human brain‚Äôs natural tendency to focus better in short bursts. By limiting work to 25-minute intervals, you avoid feeling overwhelmed and tired, which helps maintain a high level of concentration throughout the day. Additionally, the regular breaks provide a moment to rest, recharge, and refresh your mind before diving back into another Pomodoro.',
